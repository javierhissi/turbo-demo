  <h3>Monorepo key points</h3>
  <ul class="bullet-li-text">
    <li class="fragment">
      <span class="bullet-mono">Visibility: </span> everyone can see everyone else’s code. This
      property leads to better collaboration and cross-team contributions.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      <span class="bullet-mono">Simpler dependency management: </span> sharing dependencies is
      trivial. There’s little need for a package manager as all modules are hosted in the same
      repository.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      <span class="bullet-mono">Single source of truth: </span> one version of every dependency
      means there are not versioning conflicts and no dependency hell.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      <span class="bullet-mono">Consistency: </span> enforcing code quality standards and a unified
      style is easier when you have all your codebase in one place.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      <span class="bullet-mono">Shared timeline: </span> breaking changes in APIs or shared
      libraries are exposed immediately, forcing different teams to communicate ahead and join
      forces.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      <span class="bullet-mono">Atomic commits: </span> atomic commits make large-scale refactoring
      easier. A developer can update several packages or projects in a single commit.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      <span class="bullet-mono">Implicit CI: </span> continuous integration is guaranteed as all the
      code is already unified in one place.
    </li>
